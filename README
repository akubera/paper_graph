Alright, I made a version of that javascript which should work on anyone's computer.

Data is stored in the file "paper_data". It is a list of JSON objects which have id of the paper's name and a list of reference paper name.

There are two fake papers in the file initially, test_a and test_b.

To start, open index.html in the browser (not an editor) and it should have test_a and test_b on the side panel. Click to make sure they produce the graphs.

I have another file used to create these objects - click Create at the top of the page to show the builder.

put the filename in the field labeled "This Paper Id : " (i.e. hep-ph-0201010) Then get the references from arXiv or Inspire 
(http://arxiv.org/refs/hep-ph/0201010) Just copy the whole list and paste in "input". Clicking Find will highlight the properly formed article names.  should 
be red in the scanned box.

Then click Reduce to give the final object. Something like this:

{"hep-ph-0201010":["nucl-ex/0109003","nucl-ex/0105011","nucl-th/9812021","hep-ph/9309289","hep-ph/9311205","hep-ph/0006326","hep-ph/9807513","hep-ph/9903358","hep-ph/9904404","hep-ex/0010051","hep-ph/0105195","hep-ph/9607355","hep-ph/9807297","hep-ph/9908245","hep-ph/0011155","hep-ph/0110221","hep-ph/9802440","hep-ph/9808378","hep-ph/0107227","hep-ph/9807211","hep-ph/0003136","hep-ph/9509362"]}


Copy that into the list in the paper_data file and reload index.html, they should show up on the graph. 

===== NOTE ======
You MUST have commas separating things in the paper_data list [{stuff_1}, {stuff_2}]. If it's in a bad format it'll complain.
================= 

The *Paper Source* field doesn't do anything, yet.
